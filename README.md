# Vivi — Agentic Activity Network

“You bring the mood. Your friends bring the vibe. AI orchestrates the plan.”

Vivi is a full-stack reimagining of the Yumi social-agentic platform, pivoting from food discovery to activity discovery. The system coordinates group moods, taste graphs, and live event data to suggest the perfect shared experience. The repo now targets a Netlify-hosted web app paired with a FastAPI backend you can deploy on your preferred free-tier provider (Railway, Fly.io, Cloud Run, etc.).

---

## Architecture

- **Frontend** — Vite + React web app (`frontend/`) that captures natural language mood prompts, lets you tag friends, and renders AI-curated plan cards.
- **Backend** — FastAPI service (`backend/`) orchestrating multi-agent planning (listener → profile → merge → explorer → writer → scheduler) with pluggable tool functions.
- **Data Contracts** — Typed schemas in `backend/schemas.py`; mock tool implementations ready to be swapped for Supabase, Google Places, Eventbrite, Meetup, TikTok sentiment, etc.
- **Deployment** — `netlify.toml` drives the static build on Netlify. Deploy the FastAPI backend separately (Railway shown below) and point the frontend via `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

## Getting Started

### 1. Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn backend.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Test locally:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/plan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "query_text": "We are broke, want outdoor music near Cambridge after 5pm.",
        "user_ids": ["u1","u2","u3"],
        "location_hint": "Cambridge, MA",
        "time_window": "today 5-8pm"
      }'
```

### 2. Frontend (React)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000` in a `.env.local` file to point at the FastAPI service.

## Deploying the Backend (Railway example)

1. Install the Railway CLI and log in: `npm i -g @railway/cli && railway login`.
2. From the repo root run `railway init`, choose “Empty Project,” and follow prompts.
3. Set build/run commands in the Railway dashboard (or `.railway/config.json`):
   - Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start: `uvicorn backend.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`
4. Add environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_API_KEY`, etc.).
5. Deploy — Railway will expose a public HTTPS URL (note the port defaults to 8080).

Any other container-friendly host (Fly.io, Google Cloud Run, Heroku, DigitalOcean App Platform) can reuse those commands.

## Deploying the Frontend (Netlify)

The included `netlify.toml` configures Netlify to build from the `frontend/` directory.

1. Push this repo to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
2. In Netlify, click “Add new site” → “Import an existing project.”
3. Choose the repo and branch. Netlify reads `netlify.toml`, so the build command becomes:
   - Base directory: `frontend`
   - Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
4. Set environment variable `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (under Site settings → Build & deploy → Environment) to the public URL of your backend (e.g. `https://vivi-api-production.up.railway.app`).
5. Deploy. Each push to the selected branch auto-triggers a rebuild.

Optional: remove or adjust the redirect in `netlify.toml` once you know your backend URL.

## Extending to Production

- Replace `backend/tools.py` stubs with live integrations (Supabase for profiles, Google Places/Eventbrite/Meetup for activities, TikTok/Reddit scrapers for vibe validation).
- Swap `llm_json` in `backend/agents.py` with calls to Gemini Flash or Claude 3.5 via function calling.
- Add embeddings via `sentence-transformers` to compute merge weights and history-aware recommendations.
- Wire a scheduler agent to auto-create calendar invites or group texts (e.g., via Twilio).
- Expand frontend with authentication, saved crews, and “auto-nudge” predictions (“You and @Rajesh are free Sunday; want a mindful hike?”).

## Hackathon Pitch Snapshots

- **Concept** — Vivi mediates “What should we do?” decisions better than any group chat.
- **Agent Graph** — Listener → Profile → Merge → Explorer → Writer → Scheduler.
- **Demo Flow** — natural language mood input → structured intent → merged taste graph → ranked experiences with vibe scores.
- **Next** — Voice concierge, trust graphs, cross-city itineraries, and automated booking concierge.

Bring the vibes, let Vivi orchestrate the rest. </>
